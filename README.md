# Simple Block Game

Just a simple block matching game that I build with **ReactJS** and **ES2015**.

## Try it out

- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

## TODO

- Blocks seem to have trouble finding other blocks of same colour
after a few have been removed.
- Currently, the only way to know when blocks are done detecting each other
is with a simple timeout. Need some way to alert the Game class when all
blocks are done searching.
- Visuals could use some TLC
